========================================================

This is a project dedicated to retreive, process and create information about uploaded pictures/videos from the image board website [pr0gramm.com](http://pr0gramm.com). We do this to get a meta-view on a contemporary web project. The script we developed to fetch the data could also be used to support scientific research (cultural sciences, communication sciences, philosophy, sociology).

On the [project page](http://pr0stats.github.io) we publish our analyses. Some - but not all - of these analyses are also [published on pr0gramm.com](http://pr0gramm.com/user/pr0stats).

Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/pr0stats/pr0stats/issues/new) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/pr0stats/pr0stats/compare/) if you find something that could be improved. We also encourage to submit an issue to request a specific analysis.
